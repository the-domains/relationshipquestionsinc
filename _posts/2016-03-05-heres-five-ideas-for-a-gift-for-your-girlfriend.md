# Here's five ideas for a gift for your girlfriend:

## 1\. Flowers and chocolate

Its so simple but its almost
expected and if you don't get at least flowers, you will come off as an
insensitive prickly pear. Even if you can't afford a dozen roses, one red rose
will do the job. As for chocolate, who doesn't love chocolate?! If you want to take
it step further, pair roses and chocolate with a poem. If you can't rhyme or
poems aren't your thing, try a short note or letter expressing your love for
your significant other. Do these three and you will need no more. 

## 2\. Mixtape 

If your girlfriend is allergic to chocolate or if you're
afraid they will melt, go for an oldie but goodie: a mix tape/CD with songs you
both enjoy. If you're too young to know what a CD is, you shouldn't even be
dating, learn how to wipe your ass first. 

## 3\. Picnic lunch or dinner. 

Even if all you do is pick up
pizza and a blanket, a picnic is one of the most romantic things you can do.
Your girl will thank you for your efforts and you can stargaze once it gets
dark.

## 4\. Man up and go get a pedicure

just DO IIIIIT. Every girl
likes to get pampered and you will really take her by surprise if you go get a
pedicure together. Plus I'm sure your toe nails and get a little clean up. From
nasty toes to twinkle toes in less than one hour and a few Hamiltons.

## 5\. Buy her a pet

Almost any girl's dream is a puppy or a
kitten. If you're both afraid of that commitment, a fish will do.
